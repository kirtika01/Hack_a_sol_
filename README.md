##Road Connectivity in Rural, Hilly Terrains: DEM Data Analysis (Durg, Chhattisgarh)
#Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road connectivity challenges in rural, hilly terrains of India, particularly in the Durg district, Chhattisgarh. The goal is to identify regions where new roads need to be constructed or existing roads require upgrades. By using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, the project evaluates geographic and terrain conditions, providing insights for optimizing road construction and planning in a cost-effective manner.

The system utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) to download and analyze DEM data for the Durg district, combining geographic information with terrain data to assist in better road planning.
