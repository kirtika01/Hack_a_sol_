# Road Connectivity in Rural, Hilly Terrains: DEM Data Analysis (Durg, Chhattisgarh)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road connectivity challenges in rural, hilly terrains of India, particularly in the Durg district, Chhattisgarh. The goal is to identify regions where new roads need to be constructed or existing roads require upgrades. By using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, the project evaluates geographic and terrain conditions, providing insights for optimizing road construction and planning in a cost-effective manner.

The system utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) to download and analyze DEM data for the Durg district, combining geographic information with terrain data to assist in better road planning.

# Key Features
-> Download and analyze DEM data for the Durg district using Google Earth Engine.
-> Visualize elevation data using Python and matplotlib.
-> Identify regions where new roads are necessary or existing roads require upgrading.
-> Process and clip DEM data for a defined geographic bounding box.

# Technologies Used
-> Python: Core programming language.
-> Google Earth Engine: Platform to access and process satellite data.
-> geemap: Python package to interface with Google Earth Engine.
-> rasterio: Library to work with geospatial raster data.
-> matplotlib: Visualization library for graphical representation of elevation data.
